##### Heroku error H13
- issue:
2022-01-16T05:42:46.647588+00:00 heroku[router]: at=error code=H13 desc="Connection closed without response" method=GET path="/" host=hustlo.herokuapp.com request_id=5f2e7b19-578c-4951-981e-2c5249507cdc fwd="211.44.147.213" dyno=web.1 connect=0ms service=1ms status=503 bytes=0 protocol=https
- cause: Heroku's load balancer terminates the TLS traffic before it gets to the dyno, and I was using the 'https' module and passing self-signed TLS cert paths as an option. After updating to use 'http,' the error was resolved.

##### Add custom domains on Netlify
- issue: Netlify's Custom Domains panel showed "Check DNS configuration" message, not the "Netlify DNS", and not pointed to the custom domain.
- cause: forgot to add an A record which means the IPv4 address of the hosting server(Netlify's load balancer) on GoDaddy. Right after I updated the A and CNAME records correctly, it started working.
