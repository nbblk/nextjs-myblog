#### Netlify DNS disconnected error
- issue: Sometimes the custom root domain couldn't be connected to the Netlify load balancer with DNS disconnected error. 
- cause: I found out the reason might be the default A record in the GoDaddy DNS records that points to the "parked" value with the same prefix(@) as another A record I added where points to the Netlify's load balancer IP address. After I deleted the "parked" record, the site started working well.
