**What is a prototype and a mockup?**


A prototype is a properly working web app or mobile app, or just a paper of sketches that allows designers to test *the user journey*. Although the level of fidelity may vary, it is useful for generating meaningful user feedback from a user experience perspective.


A mockup is the highest-fidelity visualized product with uniformed typography, iconography, color, and overall style.  So it mainly focuses on how the stakeholders respond to the brand and storyline of the product from a real user's perspective.


> The wireframe is the skeleton; the barebone structure of the product. The prototype is the brain; the organ that decides how the human should move and interact with > those around him/her. The mockup is the skin, hair, and facial features, or *brand*, that makes the human instantly recognizable.

I sketched some wireframes of my bookmark web app yesterday, and I am digitizing them using Figma. The most interesting feature is a *component* one, which is for reusing the visual element across the pages. But it could be cumbersome if I have to create a different variant of the same component by its scale.
