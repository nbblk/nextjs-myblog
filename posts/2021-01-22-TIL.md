**git clone command**
- `git clone` is a command for making completely isolated local or remote copy of existing repo at a new directory.
- It implicitly initialize a new repo using `git init` first, then clone the original repo to the target directory. 
- Git automatically sets a remote connection called 'origin' to point back to the original repo by creating refs to the remote branch heads.
