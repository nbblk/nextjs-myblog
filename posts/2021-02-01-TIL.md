**Difference between authentication to authorization**
- Authentication is an initial step used when the user or device tries to enter the system.
- It is the process of validating the credential of a user or device by using an algorithm for verifying the credential's integrity. 
- The credential includes the id tokens of passwords, biometrics, pins, apps, etc. It is passed to the system by visible GUI or CUI from the user.
- Authorization is the process of granting permission to the authenticated user or device to access a certain resource on the system. 
- Policy about whom to grant the access or not is maintained by a security administrator, and the whole process is invisible to the user or device.
- As a result, authentication is the first-step protection of permit or deny external user or device, and authorization is a conditional security filter to allow or not allow the request from them.

**Break the OAuth down**
- OAuth is a framework of authentication that enables one serivce to delegates the authentication to 3rd party apps.
- OAuth uses four roles to structure the framework: resource owner, client, resource server, and authorization server.
    - Resource Owner is the service whom takes the user's account: *user*.
    - Resource / Authorization Server verifies the credential of a user and generate an access token to user: *API*.
    - Client is the application that requests to the Authorization server. *application*.
- The whole flow is like: 
(1) *Application* requests to *user(resource owner)* to authorize.\ 
(2) *User* grants the access from the *application*.\
(3) *Application* requests to *Service API(auth)* to issue an access token.\ 
(4) With the given access token, the *application* requests the *Service API(resource)* and the server responds.\
