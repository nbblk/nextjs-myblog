**React Context Component**
- With using the context, you don't need to pass the props redundantly through components until the target component is matched.
- The data you broadcast by context is mostly used as 'global' props like color themes, locale, data cache, etc.
- Provider passes a context-related data with 'value' prop to consumer components.
- Consumer gets the context from the nearest provider component.
- When the state in a context is updated, all consumers subscribing to the context is rerendered.
