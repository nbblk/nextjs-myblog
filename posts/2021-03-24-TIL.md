_What is a constructor in JS?_

- It is also known as _constructor function_ or _constructor function object_.
- It is the type of function which initializes an object with given arguments.
- The difference with the non-constructor function is whether \[[Construct]] method exists. It is the internal method that has to be implemented to take the arguments of the function or super() and the object to which the `new` operator was initially applied.
- That means, not all functions(function objects) are constructors.
