I've started to learn TailwindCSS.\
TailwindCSS is a framework for fast implementing UI components without writing any single line of CSS. Sounds similar with Bootstrap, huh?\
The Difference with Bootstrap is that where they're focusing on. Bootstrap provides prebuilt UI components. Instead, Tailwind provides a preset of descriptive CSS classes that could be stacked up to HTML directly. It makes UI unbounded by certain framework's look-and-feel. But at first glance, It seems like Tailwind utilities(classes) would take some time to get used to what the classes mean and what class to use.
