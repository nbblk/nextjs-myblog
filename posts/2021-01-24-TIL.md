**git working directory and checkout**
- Working directory is where you have *checkout* the project.
- `checkout` is a term of switching files or commits or branches in Git.
- When you `checkout` a branch, your files in the working directory is updated with the version of the branch.
- When you `checkout` a specific commit instead of a branch, the changes you make in the working directory cannot be commited because of the `detached HEAD` state.
- `detatched HEAD` state is kind of warning that current changes wouldn't belongs to any branches. In normal case, HEAD points a latest commit of the checkout branch. But it doesn't matter if you only want to check out the older commits.
