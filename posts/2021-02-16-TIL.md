**How to handle the errors in React**
- The flow is like below:

1.  create the error state
2.  catch the error
3.  update the state with the error message
4.  render a popup with the message when the error occurs

- ErrorBoundary in a class component

1.  create the error handler function
2.  import ErrorBoundary component from 'react-error-boundary'
3.  pass the error handler function to FallbackComponent

-   You can't handle the async error with ErrorBoundary

- useErrorHandler in a hook\

1.  import useErrorHandler from 'react-error-boundary'
2.  pass an error object to the errorHandler
3.  then, you can handle runtime and async errors at once.

### 2
**Batch update in React**
- Batch update is a feature to update multiple states combining into a single update.
- The feature runs on both class components and hooks, to prevent unnecessary re-rendering.
- For example, if you update the state twice inside of the synchronous function, it will not trigger rendering twice. It is only fired once.
- And updated state value is only accessible when the next renders.
