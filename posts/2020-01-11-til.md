- While deploying this app using vecel I found this:<br/>

```
	Failed to compile.
13:46:02.059  	ModuleNotFoundError: Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '../styles/home.module.css' in '/vercel/workpath0/pages'

13:46:02.060  	Error: > Build failed because of webpack errors

```
- Resolved: I capitalized the filename into Home.module.css. The filename on remote and local was unmatched.

**What is a *wireframing*?**
<br/>
- Wireframing is a process of structuring an initial overview of a web application or mobile application into architectural, functional aspects in a user-behavior-oriented manner briefly. It is mostly used by a UX designer who decides the overall concept and system of styling, color, and graphics.
<br/>
- How to wireframe:
	1. Get inspired - by similar products (dribble, behance)
	2. Set building blocks - what user/business wants to achieve?
	3. Fill in the details - spacing, layout, information hierarchy
	4. Digitize it.
	Beware of information overload. Simplicity is always on the top.
