#### How to upload an IPA file to App Store in Windows?

- I was not sure that common tweaks like installing macOS on virtual machine, or using _hackintosh_ might work, so I picked up MacInCloud to jump in the build process faster and easier.
- MacInCloud is a cloud platform that enables you to access macOS from any device. I paid
  for Pay-as-You-Go plan becuase I was going to use for just uploading purpose.
- After you signed in and paid for the server, you'll receive a mail with a credential and instruction to connect the server.
- Connect to the server, and find the Transporter app from the applications. It is pre-installed in the server so you don't need to download it from the App Store.
- Drop the ipa file! If the upload is finished successfully, you can find the build from the App Store Connect.
