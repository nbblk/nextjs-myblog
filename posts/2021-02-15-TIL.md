### 1 
**React useEffect()**
- `function useEffect(effect: EffectCallback, deps?: DependencyList): void;`
- useEffect is a function to execute side-effects that are not directly related to the UI rendering process. It is executed right after the rendering is finished like `componentDidMount()`.
- If you pass an array as the second parameter of the function, it is executed only when the state is changed depending on the value you passed like `componentDidUpdate()`. If not, it would be executed after every render occurs and it could cause an infinite loop.

### 2
**React useCallback()**
- `function useCallback<T extends (...args: any\[\]) \=> any\>(callback: T, deps: DependencyList): T;`
- useCallback() caches the function and return the memoized version for later use. For example, if the child component renders and fetches the data in the useEffect() hook with state changed, the cached callback function is executed.
- `useCallback(fn, deps) is eqivalent to useMemo(() => fn, deps)`

### 2
**Clean up useEffect()**
- You can clean up the subscription or timer id that would be not used anymore by returning the cleaning callback in the useEffect().
- It runs before the component unmount to prevents a memory leak. So the old effect is cleaned on every update before the new effect executes.
