**Arrow function in JS**
- It has simpler syntax(`foo = () => { console.log('bar')}`) similar to lambda function, but it has more nuanced details.
- What `this` refers to: Because it doesn't have its own `this` internally unlike a normal function, it always refers to the closest `this` of non-arrow function in the outer scope.
