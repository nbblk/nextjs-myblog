**Arrow function expression in JS**
- It has simpler syntax(`foo = () => { console.log('bar')}`) similar to lambda function, but it has more nuanced details and limited features than a regular function.
- It doesn't have `this` or `super` for its own unlike a normal function, it always refers to the closest `this` of non-arrow function in the outer scope. 
- So it's not suitable for using methods like `apply()`, `call()`, `bind()`, which establish the scope with the passed-in object. 
- Also, you can't use the arguments object, `new` operator because it cannot acts as a constructor, and of course, it doesn't have a `prototype` property.
