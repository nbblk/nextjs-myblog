**How to push the document to subarray in MongoDB**
- I tried `$push` and `$addToSet` operations to do that but it didn't work.
- The reason was that I passed the update operation as the third argument(callback) of `collection.findOneAndUpdate()` method, not the second argument.
- Read a document with care!
