# 1
**Heroku deployment failure(http status 503)**
- Define
I deployed the backend code via Heroku CLI, but the running app showed me a welcome page with *503* status code(Service Unavailable).\

- Tries
1. Thought that there could be some mixed up in version history, I reset the Heroku remote repo and pushed it again from my local repo.
2. After I read the doc, I realized deployment was not done at all, and the reason was that there's a misconfigured values or typo.
<https://devcenter.heroku.com/changelog-items/68#:~:text=The%20welcome%20page%20for%20a,one%20that%20is%20working%20properly.>

- Resolved
The code was pushed but not deployed at all to Heroku so I checked the build log. The error message occurred while installing npm.\
I mistyped the version of the npm in the `package.json`. What I am using was 6.14.10 but I kept 6.15.10 on there. After fixing it out, build and deployment worked like a charm.\
**=> Read your log & check the mistyped value at least twice with care.**

# 2
**How to set up a proxy to nodejs to resolve CORS between different origins**
- Define
```
Access to fetch at 'https://${myapp}.herokuapp.com/api/v1/auth' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
```
- Tried
1. Setup amazon CloudFront to set up a proxy but the app showed 502(bad gateway) status code.
2. Googled the problems related to CloudFront settings, but couldn't get a clue.
3. Setup a proxy directly to the node server using `http-proxy-middleware` to have a context like `/api/v1`

- Resolved
After I adjust the middleware to the server, the CORS error and 502 code disappeared.\
**=> Learn and fully understand about proxy and CORS**

```
- Tries
While I find a workaround instead of accepting requests from all IPs, I found an addon from Heroku which gives a static IP to the server. \

<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42229390/connecting-to-mongodb-using-mongoose-and-fixie-heroku-add-on> <-- MongoDB seems not working on fixie socks.
The only option I had was using the enterprise option to use the private space(for static IP).
- Resolved (not fully)
I decided to accept traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 for temporary use and it works out
