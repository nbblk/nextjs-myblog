**Using Google fonts in Tailwind**\
Resolved: Add a src to the topmost css file using @import or @font-face. Then override or extend tailwind.config.js `theme.fontFamily` property.\
If you directly add font stacks to `theme.fontFamily` with same property name, you override existing font stacks. Or if you add them to `theme.fontFamily.extend`, default `sans`, `sans-serif`, `mono` stacks are stll available with newly added stacks.

**@font-face vs. @import**\
`@font-face` is used to declare a set of fonts with a style, weight, format, and accessible sources(from a local computer or a remote server) to display custom fonts without relying on web-safe fonts.\
User-agent downloads the font when rendering the referenced element. When the match is not found, it falls back to the default font.\
`@import` is used to declare external CSS resources to be conditionally included.\
`@import` defers loading fonts until the rest of HTML is fully loaded. Using \<link> in HTML is slightly faster, but it depends on the file size.
