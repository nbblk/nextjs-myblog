### 1
**git init command**

- It creates `.git` subdirectory to the working directory.
- `.git` directory contains all of the necessary metadata like objects, refs, template files, and HEAD file which points the currently checked out commit.

### 2
**git bare repository**
- `git init --bare <directory>` initialize a bare respository.
- It is a 'storage-only' repository without working directory.
- So you can push to or pull from a bare repository, but cannot edit file or commit directly unlike development environment.
- It is commonly used as a remote central repository(a.k.a a collaboration point) in the git workflow.
