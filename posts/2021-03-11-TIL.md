**Binding rules - 1. Default Binding & Strict mode**
- When there are no other rules to apply, like when you call a function plainly on a global context, it just falls back to the default binding.
- In default, **the global object** bound to *this*.
- When you want to `delete` property of the global object, there's a limit to the property declared using dot notation like `window.foo = "bar"` because the engine set the `configurable` descriptor to `false`.
- Exceptionally, when you `"use strict"` you can't access the global object by *this*, and the engine throws an error like this: `TypeError: this is undefined`.
