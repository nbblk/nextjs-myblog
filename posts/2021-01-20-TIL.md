**CORS(Cross-origin resource policy)**\
- CORS is a mechanism which defines **a way of allowing cross-origin(domain, scheme, or port) request on browsers.**
- Browsers restrict making a request to a different origin for security reasons unless the response from the other origin includes the right CORS headers.
- CORS is HTTP-header based mechanism. That means client and server communicate using `Origin`, `Access-Control-` header to check whether they can be reached to each other or not.
- CORS also relies on _preflight_ mechanism, which is the process of sending a pre-request using `OPTION` header to check whether the server permits the request or not. When accepted, the client gets a response with` Access-Control-Allow-` headers. Then the client makes the actual request to the server.
