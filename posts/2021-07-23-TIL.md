#### async and await

- `async` and `await` is a keyword and a syntactic sugar which makes the code more intuitive, readable, and shorter.
- When you use `async` before the `function` keyword, it implies that the function expects an asynchronous code.
- And actually, if you use the `async` keyword, the function returns a Promise object.
- To use the value of the Promise object fulfilled, you could use .then() block. `async` keyword tells function to return a Promise rather than directly return the value.
- `await` keyword is used to pause your code until the promise fulfills.
- If you want to use the result of the async function, the only thing you have to do is putting `await` before the function call, not writing the long chain of .then().
- You can do something when the function throws an error using .catch() without .then().
- If you have to await multiple Promises fulfilled, you could use `Promise.all()` instead of putting `await` keyword to each of the async function.
- When you put `await` before a `function` keyword, the `await` keyword causes JS runtime to pause and wait on this line of code, not allowing the next code to be executed in the meantime until its results are returned.
- If a Promise fulfilled, it assigns its result to the variable you defined.
