**How to pass React component as a prop**
- You can consider *composition* or *inheritance* patterns while using React.
- When you want to make parent component to unknown what it contains as a child, you can use `props.children` property to pass the children elements.
- You can also keep some holes in the component by passing elements as props for partial customizing.
- If you want to reuse non-UI functionality between components, it's better to extract it into a separate JS module so that the components can import it.

**What and why of props.children**
- It contains all of the nested child components.
- Any component can access them. In a class component, you can use the `this.props.children` instead.
- When you pass components as props, the components are passed uninstantiated and instantiate when retrieved.
- It is for hiding unnecessary details from the higher-order component by just passing them down.
