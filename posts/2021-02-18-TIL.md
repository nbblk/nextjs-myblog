**How to create a custom hook in React**
- A custom hook enables to isolate a general, reusable logic from components.
- You can reuse the logic in several components without concerning the data related to the logic.
- To create a custom hook, you have to define the functions to export.
- The data internally used in the custom hook is stored in an internal state and can be dispatched and updated via reducer.
- So the upshot is that you can make the codebase more cleaner by importing the custom hooks in your components and use the exported data or function of them.
