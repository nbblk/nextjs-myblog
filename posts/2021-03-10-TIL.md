**What is the call-site**
- What **call-site** means? The call-site is *the location* where the function invoked. 
- Why it is important? It is the only clue to diagnose what **this** refers in JS code.
- How can I know that? You can check it out by finding a the *second* stack just below the uppermost stack in the call stack by setting a breakpoint inside of the first line of a function using debugger.
