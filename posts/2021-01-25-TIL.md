**git staging area**
- The staging area is a file that records what is ready to be committed next, which is located in the `.git` directory. 
- When you change some files in the working directory(working tree), you can selectively choose the changes you want to stage on. 
- And the changes you chose are stored as a snapshot to the `.git` directory. 
- Staging area is useful when you split the changes into a meaningful logical commit with atomicity.
