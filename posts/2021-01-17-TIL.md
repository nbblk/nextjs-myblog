**Selecting classes dynamically in Tailwind**

- Problem: Failed to concatenate classes dynamically
- Resolved: Use *complete* class name when you select them. Tailwind uses *PurgeCSS* under the hood, which is simply looking for any matches to their regular expression without parsing HTML or executing the JS code and optimizes unused selectors for production.

**React Router useHistory**
- `useHistory` is a React Router API for React Hooks. It gives you an *history* instance which is can be used in navigation.
- `history` is a package of React Router that provides several ways of managing JS session history in DOM-specific or non-DOM specific environments. 
- the `history object` is immutable, so it's recommended to be accessed inside of lifecycle hooks.
